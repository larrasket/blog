* Tadiwn — تدوين: blogging with elisp

This repository holds code for my publishing system that I use for my [[https://lr0.fly.dev/][website]],
written in elisp.
** Requirements
+ ~tadwin.el~ uses the ~doomscript~ executor to access emacs, thus it requires
  a [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][doom emacs]] installation, however this can be modified easily to use a
  vanilla emacs instead.
+ ~org-roam~ is required by default to link the nodes (website org files) with
  each others, however this is can be dismissed too, but you will have to depend
  on hierarchical approach to organize your files, which often breaks.
